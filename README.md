mastiff - automated test framework for sheepdog project
========================

Test automation framework in python and shell script.

It can read case description from formated files and test the case.

It will produce one html report and send report by email.

The expected result can either be a string or the exit status of comand. The exit status can be expected as $?0 or $?!0. 

The test cases are for sheepdog project now.

I used ssh tool to do cluster test. Please refer to howto getting more information.

It can also be used as common test framework.
