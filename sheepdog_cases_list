	case 1, create one VDI for the next deletion

	case 2, delete the created VDI 

7, test snapshot

	case 1, create one base VDI

	case 2, write the base VDI at offset 0

	case 3, create the snapshot for base VDI

	case 4, write the base VDI at offset 0 with the other data 

	case 5, read base VDI, check the data is new data or not

	case 6, read snapshot, check the data is old data or not

8, one node leave/join, cluster recovery

	case 1, kill sheepdog at local host, use 'ps' command to find the first
		thread of sheepdog, then kill it

	case 2, dummy case, wait for recovery, sleep some time

	case 3, start the sheepdog again

	case 4, dummy case, wait for recovery, sleep some time

	case 5, read VDI, check the written data is right or not

	case 6, write VDI at another offset with collie tool

	case 7, read VDI at the offset, make sure the read data is same with the written data

9, two nodes leave/join, cluster recovery
	
	case 1, kill two sheepdogs at remote hosts, use 'ps' command to find the first
		thread of sheepdog at remote hosts, then kill it

	case 2, read VDI during recovey, check the written data is right or not

	case 3, write VDI at another offset with collie tool during recovey

	case 4, read VDI at the offset during recovey, make sure the read data is same with the written data

	case 5, dummy case, wait for recovery, sleep some time

	case 6, read VDI after recovey, check the written data is right or not

	case 7, write VDI at another offset with collie tool after recovey

	case 8, read VDI at the offset after recovey, make sure the read data is same with the written data

	case 9, start the sheepdogs again

	case 10, read VDI during recovey, check the written data is right or not

	case 11, write VDI at another offset with collie tool during recovey

	case 12, read VDI at the offset during recovey, make sure the read data is same with the written data

	case 13, dummy case, wait for recovery, sleep some time

	case 14, read VDI after recovey, check the written data is right or not

	case 15, write VDI at another offset with collie tool after recovey

	case 16, read VDI at the offset after recovey, make sure the read data is same with the written data

a1, test shutdown/restart cluster

	case 1, shutdown the cluster

	case 2, dummy case, after shutdown need sleep some time  

	case 3, start the sheepdog at local host

	case 4, start the sheepdog at remote hosts

	case 5, dummy case, wait for the cluster to start and sleep some time

	case 6, get nodes list, check if all of nodes have joined

	case 7, get VDIs list, check one of VDI has started or not

	case 8, get VDIs list, check one of VDI has started or not

	case 9, get VDIs list, check one of VDI has started or not

	case 10, read VDI, check the written data is right or not

	case 11, write VDI at another offset with collie tool

	case 12, read VDI at the offset, make sure the read data is same with the written data

a2, pressure test, create VDI

	case 1, create VDI at multible nodes at the same time, in the script specify how many nodes

	case 2, dummy case, sleep some time, wait for the pressure test over

	case 3, get nodes list, check if some nodes crash

a3, pressure test, read/write 

	case 1, read/write VDI at multible nodes at the same time, in the script specify how many nodes

	case 2, dummy case, sleep some time, wait for the pressure test over

	case 3, get nodes list, check if some nodes crash
